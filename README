RelatesTo
=========

Relates To provides easy ways to have dual polymorphic bindings between objects
with 'natures' included. For instance, if you have users and groups, a user might
be related to a group as a leader. This plugin is designed to provide simple-to-use
association-like methods to set up relationships and provide all of the necessary
helper methods that go with.


Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  relates_to :groups, :as => [:leader, :member]
end

class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_related :users, :as => [:leader, :member]
end

@user = User.find(:first)
@group = Group.find(:first)

@user.relates_to(@group, :as => :leader)
@user.groups # => [@group]
# TODO
@user.groups.as_member # => []
@user.groups.as_leader # => [@group]

@group.users # => [@user]
# TODO
@group.users.members # => []
@group.users.leaders # => [@user]
